# bpe-algorithm

here's the lowdown on this code:

so, we've got this thing called `encoder`. think of it like a secret agent that can both disguise (encode) and reveal (decode) messages. it's got a bunch of tools in its toolkit - `encoder`, `decoder`, `byte_encode`, `byte_decode`, and `bpe_ranks`. 

now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty:

- `rune_slice_from_string(s)`: alright, so imagine you've got a string, like "hello". this function breaks it down into its individual characters, kinda like tearing a word into individual letters. so "hello" becomes ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'].

- `get_encoder(filename_encoder, filename_bpe)`: this is where the magic starts. it's like the secret agent getting its mission briefing. it reads two files - one for encoding and one for this thing called bpe (byte pair encoding). bpe is like a secret language, where common pairs of letters get their own special code. for example, in english, "th" is super common, so instead of always writing "th", bpe might just use "z". 

- `get_pairs(word)`: this one's simple. give it a word, and it'll give you back all the pairs of letters in that word. like "hello" will give [('h', 'e'), ('e', 'l'), ('l', 'l'), ('l', 'o')].

- `bpe(token)`: here's where the real action happens. this function takes a word (or token) and keeps squishing it using the bpe rules until it can't squish no more. so if our bpe rule is to replace "ll" with "z", "hello" becomes "hezo".

- `encode(text)`: give this function a bunch of text, and it'll return a secret code. it breaks the text into words, turns each word into its bpe form, and then turns that into numbers using the `encoder` tool. so "hello world" might become something like [5, 23, 89].

- `decode(tokens)`: this is the reverse of `encode`. give it the secret code, and it'll give you back the original text. so [5, 23, 89] becomes "hello world" again.
